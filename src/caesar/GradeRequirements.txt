Grade Checkpoint #1: encoding

1. JOP
2. executable jar
3. JOP - ask do you want to encode, decode, crack, or exit?
   -- branch, right now we only have encode
4. for encoding - ask for the plain text msg
5. ask for the key
6. display the encoded msg
7. loop - ask "Do you want to encode another msg (y/n)" (trap errors)
either go again, or a graceful exit

Grade Checkpoint #2: decoding

1. All JOp's, exe jar
2. Select decode, you enter the coded message
3. Enter the key
4. Program decodes, JOp's the decoded msg
5. How? when you encode you shift alpha to the right (add key); decode reverses; z wrap is hard, now the a wrap

Grade Checkpoint #3: cracking (don't know the key)
